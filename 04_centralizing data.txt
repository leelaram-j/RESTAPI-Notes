remember to centralize the data in properties file.
like host name and key

for resources and body, create a separate class under resources folder


create a returning method as that of page object model returining elements.



public static String GenerateStringFromResource(String path) throws IOException
{
return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(path)));
}

the above function will return th xml as a string making it easier for reading. put this function in a base class or resource folder.
