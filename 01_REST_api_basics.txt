What is rest api

rest api defines a set of operations where developers can perform requests and receive responses via http protocol.

eg.

rest api call--json/xml

traffic and zip code

Bussiness logic layer: rest api http calls -act as layer btn forntend and 

weather report db


Key principles of rest:
1) represent everything with a uniue id
2) make use of standard http requests get,put,post,delete
3) reousrces have multiple representations.

rest api:-platform/language independent
google maps.
json/xml


validate i/p and response recived


1)endpoint- baseurl/resource?parameters

baseurl---particular url of the service im trying to hit(host name)
resources--multiple resources, we need to give the particular resource we need
parameters---data passed in url,? separates resources and parameters

2)types of rest requests

get,post,put,delete

get-to retreive data from server to user
can only be parameterized in endpoint

post-/payload
parameters shd be sent in xml/json in body section


put-:
replacing existing data.
same as post, data should be sent in payload

delete:
delete something in server
same as post, data should be sent in payload


3)headers/cookies
header value--this is encapsulated in the request. server reads this and authenticates the request. 
key=
content-type=json [response to be given from server]


jira eg
first request to login-gives session id as response
second request you need to log a bug, for that we need to send the session id and log the bug.
